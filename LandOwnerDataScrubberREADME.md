# üè† Land Owner Data Scrubber

A Streamlit web application that automatically cleans landowner lists by removing unwanted entities such as government organizations, utilities, churches, and other non-individual property owners.

## üéØ Purpose

- Government entities (counties, cities, townships)
- Utility companies (gas, electric, water)
- Religious organizations (churches, denominations)
- Educational institutions (school districts)
- Public services (fire departments, hospitals)
- Cemeteries and conservation authorities

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Adding Custom Keywords

Example custom keywords:
```
association
foundation

### Modifying Default Patterns

To permanently modify the filtering patterns, edit the `get_scrub_patterns()` function in the code. Each pattern is a regular expression that matches against the owner names.

- **Removal Statistics**: Shows how many entries were removed vs. retained
- **Detailed List**: View all removed entries before downloading

## üîß Technical Details

- **Built with**: Streamlit, Pandas, OpenPyXL
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses regular expressions for flexible text matching
- **Processing**: All data processing happens locally in your browser
- **Privacy**: No data is sent to external servers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File won't upload:**
- Ensure file is in Excel format (.xlsx or .xls)
- Check file isn't corrupted or password protected
- Try with a smaller file to test

**App runs slowly:**
- Large files (>10MB) may take longer to process
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

**Unexpected removals:**
- Review the removed entries list to see what was filtered
- Use custom keywords to add specific patterns
- Check if owner names contain filtered keywords unexpectedly

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error message displayed in the app
2. Verify your input file format and structure
3. Try with a smaller sample file first
