## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No rows with valid mobile/voip phones found"**
- Check that your LandPortal export contains phone type columns with "Mobile" or "Voip" values
- Verify the export includes the standard LandPortal column structure
- Ensure phone numbers are properly formatted in the LandPortal data

**"Certificate errors during installation"**
```bash
pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org streamlit pandas openpyxl
```

**"Streamlit command not found"**
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

**Large LandPortal files processing slowly**
- This is normal for LandPortal exports with thousands of property records
- Progress bars show current conversion status
- Consider processing in smaller geographic batches if needed

**LaunchControl import issues**
- Verify the cleaned file format matches LaunchControl's import requirements
- Check that phone numbers are properly formatted (10 digits)
- Ensure all required columns are present in the output
